    The build quiet period is designed to assist with CVS checkouts by waiting for a specific period of time without
    commits. Normally you want the checkout to reflect the time when the quiet period was exited successfully.
    Select this option if you need to re-enable the legacy behaviour of Jenkins, i.e. using the time that the build
    started checking out as the timestamp for the checkout operation. Note: enabling this option can
    result in the quiet period being defeated especially in those cases where the build is not able to start immediately
    after exiting the quiet period.
